        <h2>Our First Year Together</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>My Love,</p>
            <p>Happy 1st anniversary to us! One year ago, we took a leap of faith—choosing love despite the miles between us. And here we are, stronger than ever, proving that distance is just a test of how far love can travel.</p>
            <p>This year hasn't been easy, but every late-night call, every "good morning" text, and every countdown until we meet again has been worth it. You've turned ordinary moments into something extraordinary, even from afar.</p>
            <p>I miss you more than words can say, but I'm also so proud of us. We've built trust, patience, and a love that doesn't waver, no matter the time zones or goodbyes.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being my rock, my joy, and my favorite adventure. Here's to the memories we've made and the countless ones still to come.</p>
            <p>I love you more than the distance between us.</p>

        <h2>Still Choosing Us</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>My Love,</p>
            <p>Two years. Two whole years of loving you through screens, time zones, and the kind of distance that would've made weaker people give up. And yet, here we are—still stubborn, still stupidly in love, still proving every single day that this thing between us is bigger than any map could ever show.</p>
            <p>I won't lie—there are moments when this feels impossible. When I see couples holding hands or hear about friends going on dumb little dinner dates, and it hits me all over again: we should've had that by now. But then I remember: we have something they'll never understand.</p>
            <p>We built love out of nothing—no convenience, no easy touches, no shortcuts. Just us. Just choosing each other, again and again, even when it hurts. Even when the distance feels like it's gonna break me.</p>
            <p>You're my favorite person. My best friend. The one I want to complain about traffic to, the one I want to grow old and grumpy with. And yeah, it kills me that I still don't know how you smell in the morning. But I do know how your voice goes soft when you're tired. I know the exact way you type when you're trying not to laugh. I know the way you love me—fully, fiercely, like distance is just some temporary bullshit we'll laugh about someday.</p>
